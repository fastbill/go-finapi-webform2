finAPI Web Form 2.0

The following pages give you some general information on how to use our APIs.<br/>The actual API services documentation then follows further below. You can use the menu to jump between API sections.<br/><br/>This page has a built-in HTTP(S) client, so you can test the services directly from within this page, by filling in the request parameters and/or body in the respective services, and then hitting the TRY button. Note that you need to be authorized to make a successful API call. To authorize, refer to the '<a target='_blank' href='https://docs.finapi.io/?product=access#tag--Authorization'>Authorization</a>' section of Access, or in case you already have a valid user token, just use the QUICK AUTH on the left.<br/>Please also remember that all user management functions should be looked up in <a target='_blank' href='https://docs.finapi.io/?product=access'>Access</a>.<br/><br/>You should also check out the <a target='_blank' href='https://documentation.finapi.io/webform/'>Web Form 2.0 Public Documentation</a> as well as <a target='_blank' href='https://documentation.finapi.io/access/'>Access Public Documentation</a> for more information. If you need any help with the API, contact <a href='mailto:support@finapi.io'>support@finapi.io</a>.<br/><h2 id=\"general-information\">General information</h2><h3 id=\"general-request-ids\"><strong>Request IDs</strong></h3>With any API call, you can pass a request ID via a header with name \"X-Request-Id\". The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error.<br/><br/>If you don't pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally.<br/><br/>The request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with name \"X-Request-Id\".<br/><br/>We highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your client application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response(especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end. Having a request ID can help the finAPI support team to work more efficiently and solve tickets faster.<h3 id=\"type-coercion\"><strong>Type Coercion</strong></h3>In order to ease the integration for some languages, which do not natively support high precision number representations, Web Form 2.0 API supports relax type binding for the openAPI type <code>number</code>, which is used for money amount fields. If you use one of those languages, to avoid precision errors that can appear from <code>float</code> values, you can pass the amount as a <code>string</code>.<h3 id=\"general-faq\"><strong>FAQ</strong></h3><strong>Is there a finAPI SDK?</strong><br/>Currently we do not offer a native SDK, but there is the option to generate an SDKfor almost any target language via OpenAPI. Use the 'Download SDK' button on this page for SDK generation.<br/><br/><strong>Why do I need to keep authorizing when calling services on this page?</strong><br/>This page is a \"one-page-app\". Reloading the page resets the OAuth authorization context. There is generally no need to reload the page, so just don't do it and your authorization will persist.
